# Redux to GraphQL

The [Redux tutorial app](https://redux.js.org/advanced/example-reddit-api),  built with GraphQL & Apollo!

## Development

### Server

```bash
cd server && npm i && npm start
```

### Client

Make sure the server is running before you start up the client. To get the full experience, install the [Apollo VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=apollographql.vscode-apollo) for some extra magic. âœ¨

```bash
cd client && npm i && npm start
```
